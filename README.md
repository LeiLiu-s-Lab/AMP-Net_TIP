# AMP-Net: Denoising based Deep Unfolding for Compressive Image Sensing
This repository provides a pytorch-based implementation of paper **AMP-Net: Denoising based Deep Unfolding for Compressive Image Sensing** which is accepted by **IEEE Transactions on Image Processing**.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.6 (or higher)
* Pytorch 1.2~1.7 with NVIDIA GPU or CPU (We did not test other versions)
* numpy

## Dataset
We use BSDS500 for training, validation and testing, and Set11 is for testing.
BSDS500 contains 500 colorful images. And we use its luminance componient for all experiments.
Users can download the pre-processed BSDS500 from [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sghDOPR9Ehucq9yLfQ2pEiG2ckMu70cY/view),
and extract it under **./dataset/**.

**dataset.py** contains two classes for packaged training sets. 

* class **dataset**: is developed for dataset contains images sized of 33*33.
* class **dataset_full**: is developed for dataset contains images sized of 99*99.

Users can generate packaged datasets by using this two classes.
